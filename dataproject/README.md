# Data analysis project

Our project is titled **Danish Unemployment** and is about how the Danish Unemployment has changed during the last 5 years. We both look at the general picture, but also seperate the unemployment into men and women. We have also created a widget for looking at each municipality seperately.

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [dataproject.ipynb](dataproject.ipynb).

This **loades two datasets**:

1. table AUF01 downloaded using pydst
2. table AUF02 downloaded using pydst

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires the following installations:

``pip install git+https://github.com/elben10/pydst``
